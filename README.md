An Octave (.m) set of scripts to simulate effect of parameters in MaslowCNC kinematics

It was used to prepare this [post on the MaslowCNC community forum](https://forums.maslowcnc.com/t/list-of-sources-of-error/7523/22?u=c0depr1sm)

You can [get octave for free](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/), it is a free open source software for mathematical work.

To start using the modeling tool
1. Clone this repository,
2. [Get Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/)
3. Launch Octave and change the active directory to the cloned repository by browsing (clicking on the uper-left "file Browser" string selector) 
4. in the octave command window, type sweepdeltaXY_Catenary_and_targeted_Error and hit enter.
5. In the Octave editor tab, open a file (menu just above the editor area) and look at the script code)
