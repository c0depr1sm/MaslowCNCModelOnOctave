## What? This function compares the xy position achieved when comparing the parabola 
## approximation for chain sag and chain tension with the exact catenary formula.

## How? It computes chain lengths on straign sprocket tiragular kynematics, then refines 
## it with the parabola estimation like the current Maslow firmware. It then redoes it but 
## this time with an implementation of an successive approximation to fit the catenary function.
## It collects the difference between parabola and catenary xy errors likely occuring on sled positioning. 
## due to the more accurate catenary calculation.

## Limits? 
## it is important to adjust the sag correction factor (like the one in the maslow firmware).
## In the command window, get a plain left chain length value for the lower left corner by typing:
# inverse(1200, -600,"bare")
# ans =  3497.1
## you get the parabola version here (the one using the sag correction factor)
# inverse(1200, -600,"allparabola")
# ans =  3498.5
## and here you get the one using a catenary equation (relying on sled weigh and chain density)
# inverse(1200, -600,"allcatenary")
# ans =  3498.5
## Now you would want to get the parabola to match the catenary, so compute the chain length difference:
# inverse(1200, -600,"allparabola")(1)-inverse(1200, -600,"allcatenary")(1)
# ans =   -7.9500e-04
##
## if you don't get a very small difference on "parabola" and "catenary", tweak the inverse.m
## function parameter "chainSagCorrectionFactor".
##

## Usage: 
##  Just run the script. It yields 3 figures where the xy plane is a sweep of the workspace in mm. 
##  fig 1 is the xy distance from parabola estimation to catenary estimation. 
##  fig 2 is the x error to be added to the parabola estimation to reach the catenary. 
##  fig 3 is the y error to be added to the parabola estimation to reach the catenary.  
##
##  Then change the parameters in the list below and into inverse.m to set more specific conditions

## earth location parameters
accG = 9.8; ## m/s^2
