## What? This function compares the xy position achieved when comparing the ideal 
## model calculation with a similar one having a parameter error.
## it includes sag with the catenary formula, tension, flex, offsets, etc (see parameter lists)
## you can cheat several parameters (see cheat codes into inverse.m)

## How? It computes chain lengths on straign sprocket triangular kynematics, then refines 
## it with the catenary estimation and the parameter error of your choice. Coming up with a set of chain lengths.
## It then forward chain length back to XY coorinates (like the maslow firmware does), but this time with the no
## error model.
## It collects the difference between target and "acheived" XY coordinates. That is the estimated xy 
## errors on sled positioning.

## Usage: 
##  Just run the script. It yields 3 figures where the xy plane is a sweep of the workspace in mm. 
##  fig 1 is the xy distance from first estimation model to second estimation model. 
##  fig 2 is the x error added to the target position.
##  fig 3 is the y error added to the target position.

    workspaceX(i,j) = xposraw;
    yposraw = y_zone(j);
    workspaceY(i,j) = yposraw;
    
    ## initial geometry and chains lenght estimation -> call first to get chain angles estimations
    [leftChainExtent_raw, rightChainExtent_raw] = inverse(xposraw, yposraw,"allcatenary_with_error");
    
    ## get back to x and y position but this time include second model (maybe some more details, or some machine simulated errors)
    [xpos,ypos] = ForwardKynematics (leftChainExtent_raw, rightChainExtent_raw, xposraw, yposraw, "allcatenary_with_error2");
